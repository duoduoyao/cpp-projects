# cpp-projects

Welcome to the cpp-projects repository! 
This repository contains a collection of my past C++ projects. Each project is organized 
into its own directory, with relevant code, documentation, and examples included.

## Repository Structure

The projects are organized as follows:
- basic-stock-analysis/
	- This project focuses on basic stock data processing and analysis. It reads daily stock 
     data from CSV files, structures it using a flexible StockData class, and computes basic 
     descriptive statistics such as daily returns, average daily returns, and identifying the 
     largest gains and losses. The project demonstrates efficient use of the C++ Standard 
     Template Library (STL) for data handling.
- (I will add more projects later, e.g., “project2/”, “project3/”)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
